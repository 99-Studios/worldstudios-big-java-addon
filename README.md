# WorldStudios-Big-Java-Addon

THIS ADDON IS CURRENLY IN IT'S TESTING PHASE.

Currently, this mod supports Minecraft 1.21.4 (NeoForge 21.4.137).

This is my very first addon that I've ever made for Minecraft Java. The point of this addon is so you can have both essential and unnessiary things in your world(s), like dirt tools, challenges for the "best-of-the-best", a brand-new dimension, and a helmet that teleports you from the end to the overworld when you wear it.

Due to MCreator's limitations, I can only use NeoForge as the loader for this addon, so I'm sorry if you don't use NeoForge.
